# AutoFilter

This is a Java library that let's you automatically generate consistent filters from entities of your project. It also has a JPA integration that allows using the filters to perform queries to the database.


## Why does AutoFilter exist?

This library was partially inspired by the filtering module of [jHipster](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster) which is a powerful code generator to create fully functional applications from scratch by using good coding standards and practices. However, once created the application can be a difficult to maintain, which is a problem in any project.

Nonetheless, the idea behind jHipster and its standard structure to generate queries are very worthy of consideration, and as such this library was born. The main design pillars of this library are:
- Ease of use
- Ease to configure
- Ease to extend
## Features

- Automatic generation of filters: the filters are created from the fields of a class with a single annotation
- JPA integration: the JPA module allows using the generated filters to easily create queries to a database
- Easy to use and configure: by using simple annotations you can configure the filters just the way you need them while mantaining their consistent structure
- Filters are always up-to-date: since the filters are automatically generated then new fields that you add will be added to the filters without any need to manually modify the filters. This ensures that entities and filters are always synchronized
- Easy to extend: it's very easy to add new kinds of filters that are not supported in the base library. And you can even add some custom logic by creating subclasses of the generated filters

## Usage/Examples

A full example of usage can be found [here.](https://github.com/XiriusTech/java-learning/auto-filter)

#### Generating a filter
To generate a filter you can use the @AutoFilter annotation:

```java
public enum Region {
    AMERICA,
    EUROPE,
    OTHER
}

@AutoFilter
public class User {
    private Region userRegion;
    private String name;
    private Boolean active;
    private int strikes;
}
```

The generated filter will be:
```java
public class UserFilter implements Filter {
    private RegionFilter userRegion;
    private BasicFilter<String> name;
    private BasicFilter<Boolean> active;
    private BasicFilter<Integer> strikes;
    ...
    public static class RegionFilter extends BasicFilter<Region> {

    }
}
```

Currently the following types are automatically detected:
- Enums
- Primitive types (e.g. int)
- Primitive types boxes (e.g. java.lang.Boolean)
- java.math.BigDecimal
- java.lang.String


#### Customizing a filter

If you need to customize your filter by excluding some fields you can use @AutoFilterExclude.

If to include a non-supported type or change the type of filter of a field then you can use @AutoFilterInclude annotation, like so:

```java
@AutoFilter
public class User {
    @AutoFilterExclude
    private Region userRegion;
    private String name;
    private Boolean active;
    @AutoFilterInclude(baseFilter = CustomFilter1.class)
    private int strikes;
    @AutoFilterInclude(baseFilter = CustomFilter2.class)
    private NotSupportedType newField;
}
```

Which will generate something like:
```java
public class UserFilter implements Filter {
    private BasicFilter<String> name;
    private BasicFilter<Boolean> active;
    private CustomFilter1<Integer> strikes;
    private CustomFilter2<NotSupportedType> newField;
    ...
}
```

Please note that both generic (e.g. Filter<?>) and non-generic classes (e.g. Filter) are admitted as valid filters as long as they implement the Filter interface. However, it is strongly encouraged to create and use generic filters as that gives a higher degree of flexibility.

#### Using the filter

You can use the filter in a web request by adding it as a parameter:

```java
@GetMapping("/users")
    public Page<User> findUsers(@Valid UserFilter filter, Pageable pageable) {
        ...
    }
```

The query may look like this:
```
https://localhost:8080/users?name.equals=James&active.equal=true&strikes.in=1,2
```

#### Using the JPA integration

To know how to use the JPA module please refer to its [documentation.](https://github.com/XiriusTech/xirius-auto-filter/auto-filter-jpa).


## Installation

You may install the library by including this dependency in your maven project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>tech.xirius</groupId>
    <artifactId>auto-filter</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

You must also add the annotation processor to the build configuration:
```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${maven.version}</version>
            <configuration>
                <source>${java.version}</source>
                <target>${java.version}</target>
                <annotationProcessorPaths>
                    <path>
                        <groupId>tech.xirius</groupId>
                        <artifactId>auto-filter-core</artifactId>
                        <version>${xirius.filter.version}</version>
                    </path>
                </annotationProcessorPaths>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

You can also individually include each module, like so:

- AutoFilter Core:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>tech.xirius</groupId>
    <artifactId>auto-filter-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
- JPA integration:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>tech.xirius</groupId>
    <artifactId>auto-filter-jpa</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
